# Specster Workflow Demonstration

This document demonstrates the complete Specster workflow following the methodology described in `workflow.md`.

## Example: E-commerce Shopping Cart Feature

This demonstration follows the shopping cart example from the workflow guide to show how Specster transforms a rough idea into implementable features.

### Initial User Request

**User says**: "I want users to be able to add items to a shopping cart"

### Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

**Command**: `/spec-init shopping-cart "Enable users to manage a shopping cart with add, remove, and modify capabilities"`

**System Response**: 
```
✅ Specification 'shopping-cart' initialized successfully!
📁 Created directory: .specster/specs/shopping-cart/
📄 Files created:
   - requirements.md (from template)
   - design.md (from template) 
   - tasks.md (from template)
🔄 Current Phase: init
▶️  Next Step: Run /spec-requirements shopping-cart
```

**Command**: `/spec-requirements shopping-cart`

**System generates** (based on enhanced template):

```markdown
# Requirements Specification: Shopping Cart

## Overview

This feature enables users to manage a shopping cart where they can add, remove, and modify items before checkout. The cart should persist across sessions and provide clear feedback about item availability and pricing.

## User Stories

### Epic: Shopping Cart Management

As a customer, I want to manage items in a shopping cart, so that I can organize my purchases before checkout.

**Acceptance Criteria (EARS notation):**
- WHEN a user adds an item THEN the system SHALL update the cart immediately
- IF the cart is empty THEN the system SHALL display appropriate messaging
- WHEN a user modifies quantities THEN the system SHALL validate inventory availability

### Story 1: Add Items to Cart

As a customer, I want to add products to my shopping cart, so that I can purchase multiple items in a single transaction.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN a user clicks "Add to Cart" on a product page THEN the system SHALL add the item to their cart
2. WHEN an item is added to the cart THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message
3. WHEN an item is added THEN the cart icon SHALL update to show the new item count
4. IF a product is out of stock THEN the system SHALL disable the "Add to Cart" button
5. WHEN adding an item that's already in the cart THEN the system SHALL increase the quantity instead of creating a duplicate entry

### Story 2: View Cart Contents

As a customer, I want to view my cart contents, so that I can review my selections before purchasing.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN a user clicks the cart icon THEN the system SHALL display all cart items with names, prices, and quantities
2. WHEN the cart is empty THEN the system SHALL display "Your cart is empty" message
3. WHEN viewing the cart THEN the system SHALL show the subtotal for all items
4. WHEN viewing the cart THEN the system SHALL show estimated taxes and shipping costs

## Approval Required

🔄 **Phase Transition Gate**: Do the requirements look good? If so, we can move on to the design phase.

**Approval Status**: ⏳ Pending user approval
**Required Actions**: Please review and explicitly approve these requirements
**Available Commands**: 
- `/spec-design shopping-cart` (requires approval)
- `/spec-status shopping-cart` (check current status)
```

**Key Features**:
- ✅ EARS format properly implemented
- ✅ Comprehensive acceptance criteria
- ✅ Edge cases covered (out of stock, empty cart, etc.)
- ✅ Explicit approval required before proceeding

### Phase 2: Design Documentation

**After user approval**, the command `/spec-design shopping-cart` generates:

```markdown
# Design Document: Shopping Cart

## Overview

The shopping cart system will be implemented as a client-side state management solution with server-side persistence, following modern e-commerce patterns and best practices.

## Research Integration

### Research Question 1: Cart Persistence Strategy

**Research Findings**: Analysis of leading e-commerce platforms shows:
- Amazon: Uses server-side persistence with localStorage backup
- Shopify: Hybrid approach with immediate localStorage and async server sync
- Best Practice: Client-first with optimistic updates and conflict resolution

**Design Decision**: Implement client-first approach with localStorage for immediate persistence and background server synchronization.

### Research Question 2: Cart Merging Strategy

**Research Findings**: Industry analysis reveals:
- Amazon: Merges guest cart with user cart, keeping higher quantities
- Shopify: Prioritizes logged-in user's existing cart
- Best Practice: Give users choice when conflicts exist

**Design Decision**: Implement conflict resolution dialog showing both carts and allowing user selection.

## Key Design Decisions

### Decision 1: State Management Architecture

**Context**: Need to balance immediate UI responsiveness with data persistence

**Decision**: React Context with localStorage persistence and background server sync

**Rationale**: 
- Immediate UI updates for better user experience
- Offline capability through localStorage
- Eventually consistent with server state
- Conflict resolution for multi-device scenarios

**Consequences**: 
- Additional complexity for sync logic
- Need for conflict resolution UI
- Better perceived performance

## Approval Required

🔄 **Phase Transition Gate**: Does the design look good? If so, we can move on to the implementation tasks.

**Approval Status**: ⏳ Pending user approval
**Research Integration**: ✅ Complete (3 research areas covered)
**Architecture Validation**: ✅ Complete
**Available Commands**:
- `/spec-tasks shopping-cart` (requires approval)
- `/spec-status shopping-cart` (check current status)
```

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Research findings integrated directly into design decisions
- ✅ Architecture decisions with clear rationale
- ✅ Component interfaces and data models
- ✅ Error handling and security considerations
- ✅ Explicit approval gate before tasks

### Phase 3: Implementation Tasks

**After design approval**, the command `/spec-tasks shopping-cart` generates:

```markdown
# Implementation Tasks: Shopping Cart

## Task Breakdown

   - Acceptance criteria are specific and testable
   - Edge cases explicitly covered

3. **✅ Research-Informed Design**
   - Design decisions backed by industry research
   - Multiple research questions addressed
   - Findings directly integrated into technical decisions

4. **✅ Actionable Implementation Tasks**
   - Tasks broken down to 2-4 hour increments
   - Each task references specific requirements
   - Clear acceptance criteria and quality gates
   - Test-driven development approach

### Commands and Workflow

```bash
# Complete workflow demonstration
