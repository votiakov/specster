# Implementation Plan

## {{specName}} Feature Implementation

**Project:** {{specName}}  
**Author:** {{author}}  
**Date:** {{date}}  
**Version:** 1.0.0  

This implementation plan breaks down the {{specName}} feature into actionable coding tasks that can be executed incrementally. Each task is designed to be specific, testable, and builds upon previous work.

- **Measurable**: Success criteria that can be objectively verified
- **Achievable**: Completable within 2-4 hours of focused work
- **Relevant**: Directly contributes to meeting requirements
- **Time-bound**: Has clear completion criteria

### Task Dependencies

Tasks are organized to minimize dependencies, but some critical dependencies include:
- **Phase 1** must be complete before starting Phase 2
- **Phase 2** must be complete before starting Phase 3
- **Phase 4** can be developed in parallel with Phase 3
- **Phase 5** requires completion of relevant components from previous phases

### Quality Gates

Each task must pass these quality gates:
- [ ] Code review by team member
- [ ] Unit tests pass with adequate coverage
- [ ] Integration tests pass (where applicable)
- [ ] Requirements validation confirmed
- [ ] Security review completed (for security-sensitive tasks)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (for performance-critical tasks)
