# Implementation Plan

## Shopping Cart Feature Implementation

**Project:** shopping-cart  
**Author:** Developer  
**Date:** 2025-01-17  
**Version:** 1.0.0  

This implementation plan breaks down the shopping cart feature into actionable coding tasks that can be executed incrementally. Each task is designed to be specific, testable, and builds upon previous work.

## Task Progression Strategy

This implementation follows a structured approach:

1. **Foundation First**: Core interfaces, models, and utilities
2. **Test-Driven Development**: Tests before or alongside implementation
3. **Incremental Complexity**: Simple components before complex integrations
4. **Early Integration**: Connect pieces as soon as feasible
5. **Validation Throughout**: Testing at each level (unit, integration, e2e)

## Task Execution Guidelines

### Task Size and Scope

Each task should be:
- **Specific**: Clear objective with defined deliverables
- **Measurable**: Success criteria that can be objectively verified
- **Achievable**: Completable within 2-4 hours of focused work
- **Relevant**: Directly contributes to meeting requirements
- **Time-bound**: Has clear completion criteria

### Task Dependencies

Tasks are organized to minimize dependencies, but some critical dependencies include:
- **Phase 1** must be complete before starting Phase 2
- **Phase 2** must be complete before starting Phase 3
- **Phase 4** can be developed in parallel with Phase 3
- **Phase 5** requires completion of relevant components from previous phases

### Quality Gates

Each task must pass these quality gates:
- [ ] Code review by team member
- [ ] Unit tests pass with adequate coverage
- [ ] Integration tests pass (where applicable)
- [ ] Requirements validation confirmed
- [ ] Security review completed (for security-sensitive tasks)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (for performance-critical tasks)

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

1. **Cart State Synchronization**: Implement robust conflict resolution and offline handling
2. **Performance Under Load**: Use caching strategies and optimize database queries
3. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Implement comprehensive input validation and security testing

### Schedule Risks

1. **Complex Integration**: Allow extra time for API integration and testing
2. **Performance Optimization**: Plan for iterative performance improvements
3. **Security Implementation**: Allocate sufficient time for security reviews
