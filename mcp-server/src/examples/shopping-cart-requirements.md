# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to manage a shopping cart where they can add, remove, and modify items before checkout. The cart should persist across sessions and provide clear feedback about item availability and pricing.

**Project:** shopping-cart  
**Author:** Developer  
**Date:** 2025-01-17  
**Version:** 1.0.0  

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Add Items to Cart

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to add products to my shopping cart, so that I can purchase multiple items in a single transaction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Add to Cart" on a product page THEN the system SHALL add the item to their cart
2. WHEN an item is added to the cart THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message
3. WHEN an item is added THEN the cart icon SHALL update to show the new item count
4. IF a product is out of stock THEN the system SHALL disable the "Add to Cart" button
5. WHEN adding an item that's already in the cart THEN the system SHALL increase the quantity instead of creating a duplicate entry

#### Examples

**Example 1: Adding a new product**
- Given a user is viewing a product page with an available item
- When they click "Add to Cart"
- Then the item is added to their cart with quantity 1
- And a confirmation message "Item added to cart" is displayed
- And the cart icon shows the updated item count

**Example 2: Adding an existing product**
- Given a user has a product already in their cart
- When they add the same product again
- Then the quantity increases by 1
- And the cart shows the updated quantity

#### Edge Cases

1. **Out of Stock Items**: Users cannot add items that are out of stock
2. **Maximum Quantity Limits**: Users cannot exceed the maximum quantity per item
3. **Deleted Products**: Products removed from inventory cannot be added to cart

### Requirement 2: View Cart Contents

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to view my cart contents, so that I can review my selections before purchasing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the cart icon THEN the system SHALL display all cart items with names, prices, and quantities
2. WHEN the cart is empty THEN the system SHALL display "Your cart is empty" message
3. WHEN viewing the cart THEN the system SHALL show the subtotal for all items
4. WHEN viewing the cart THEN the system SHALL show estimated taxes and shipping costs

#### Examples

**Example 1: Viewing populated cart**
- Given a user has items in their cart
- When they click the cart icon
- Then they see a list of all items with names, prices, and quantities
- And they see the subtotal, tax, and shipping estimates

#### Edge Cases

1. **Empty Cart**: Display appropriate message when cart is empty
2. **Price Changes**: Show current prices even if they've changed since items were added
3. **Unavailable Items**: Clearly mark items that are no longer available

### Requirement 3: Modify Cart Items

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to change quantities or remove items from my cart, so that I can adjust my order before checkout.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user changes an item quantity THEN the system SHALL update the line total immediately
2. WHEN a user sets quantity to zero THEN the system SHALL remove the item from the cart
3. WHEN a user clicks "Remove" on an item THEN the system SHALL ask for confirmation
4. WHEN the last item is removed THEN the system SHALL display the empty cart message
5. IF a quantity exceeds available stock THEN the system SHALL limit it to available quantity and show a warning

#### Examples

**Example 1: Updating quantity**
- Given a user has an item in their cart with quantity 2
- When they change the quantity to 3
- Then the line total updates immediately
- And the cart subtotal is recalculated

#### Edge Cases

1. **Quantity Limits**: Cannot exceed available stock
2. **Zero Quantity**: Removes item from cart
3. **Invalid Quantities**: Only positive integers are allowed

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance Requirements

1. **Response Time**: System SHALL respond to cart operations within 2 seconds
2. **Throughput**: System SHALL handle 1000 concurrent cart operations
3. **Scalability**: System SHALL scale to 100,000 active carts without performance degradation

### Security Requirements

1. **Authentication**: Cart operations require valid user session
2. **Authorization**: Users can only modify their own carts
3. **Data Protection**: Cart data is encrypted in transit and at rest

### Usability Requirements

1. **Accessibility**: Cart interface meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards
2. **Browser Support**: Works on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
3. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Fully functional on mobile devices

## Technical Constraints

1. **Technology Stack**: React with TypeScript for frontend, Node.js API backend
2. **Integration Requirements**: Must integrate with existing product catalog and user authentication
3. **Deployment Environment**: AWS cloud infrastructure
4. **Data Storage**: PostgreSQL database with Redis caching

## Assumptions

1. User authentication system is already implemented
2. Product catalog API is available and stable
3. Payment processing will be handled by separate service

## Dependencies

1. User authentication service must be operational
2. Product catalog service must provide real-time inventory
3. Database infrastructure must support concurrent operations

## Success Criteria

This feature will be considered successfully implemented when:

1. All acceptance criteria are met and verified through testing
2. Cart operations complete within performance requirements
3. Security requirements are validated through security testing
4. User acceptance testing confirms intuitive user experience
5. Load testing confirms system can handle expected traffic

## Approval

- [ ] Requirements are complete and clearly defined
- [ ] All stakeholders have reviewed and approved the requirements
- [ ] Edge cases and error conditions are adequately covered
- [ ] Non-functional requirements are specific and measurable
- [ ] Dependencies and constraints are identified and manageable
