**New MCP Tools Added:**
- `requestApproval` - Request approval for phase transitions
- `provideApproval` - Provide explicit approval or rejection
- `getPendingApproval` - Check for pending approvals
- `checkApprovalRequirement` - Verify if approval is required

### 5. Ground-Truth Progression Principle

**Implementation:**
- No phase transitions without explicit user approval
- Automatic approval requirement checking on file saves
- Clear guidance prompts for each phase transition
- Approval validation in all phase transition methods
- Progressive establishment of ground-truths

**Key Features:**
- Explicit approval messages: "Do the requirements look good?"
- Approval tracking with timestamps and comments
- Approval history for audit trail
- Ground-truth validation before proceeding

### 6. Approval Tracking System

**Features:**
- Persistent approval state management
- Approval request expiration handling
- Approval history tracking
- Conflict resolution for multiple approvals
- User-specific approval attribution

**Database Integration:**
- Approval requests stored in workflow context
- Approval history persisted across sessions
- Workflow event logging for all approvals
- State synchronization with approval status

### 7. Shopping Cart Example Workflow

**Files:**
- `/mcp-server/src/examples/shopping-cart-requirements.md`
- `/mcp-server/src/examples/shopping-cart-design.md`
- `/mcp-server/src/examples/shopping-cart-tasks.md`

**Demonstrates:**
- Complete workflow from requirements to tasks
- Proper EARS format usage
- Research-integrated design decisions
- Granular, actionable task breakdown
- Explicit approval requirements at each phase

### 8. Enhanced User Guidance

**File:** `/mcp-server/src/examples/user-guidance.md`

**Features:**
- Step-by-step workflow walkthrough
- Common workflow patterns and solutions
- Error handling and troubleshooting
- Best practices for approval workflow
- Complete example with expected responses

### 9. Workflow Engine Enhancements

**New Configuration Options:**
```typescript
interface WorkflowConfig {
  requireExplicitApproval: boolean;
  approvalTimeout: number;
  enableApprovalWorkflow: boolean;
}
```

**Enhanced Workflow Context:**
```typescript
interface WorkflowContext {
  pendingApproval?: ApprovalRequest;
  approvalHistory: ApprovalRecord[];
}
```

### 10. Status Reporting Improvements

**Enhanced `getSpecStatus` Response:**
- Approval guidance messages
- Pending approval information
- Next action recommendations
- Ground-truth progression status

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "nextAction": "Generate design (requires approval)",
  "approvalGuidance": "Before generating design, ensure requirements are approved. Use 'Do the requirements look good?' to confirm ground-truth.",
  "pendingApproval": {...}
}
```
