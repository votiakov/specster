# Requirements Specification: Specster Implementation

## Overview

Specster implements a spec-driven development methodology using Claude Code's native capabilities (MCP servers, custom commands, and hooks) to orchestrate a three-phase workflow: requirements gathering, design documentation, and implementation task creation.

## User Stories

### Epic: Spec-Driven Development Workflow

As a developer, I want to follow a structured spec-driven development process so that I can ensure thorough planning and documentation before implementation.

**Acceptance Criteria (EARS notation):**
- WHEN a developer starts a new feature THEN the system SHALL guide them through requirements, design, and tasks phases
- WHEN a developer completes a phase THEN the system SHALL require explicit approval before proceeding
- WHEN a developer works on implementation THEN the system SHALL maintain living documentation that evolves with code changes
- IF a developer attempts to skip a phase THEN the system SHALL prevent progression and provide guidance

### Story 1: Initialize New Specification

As a developer, I want to initialize a new specification so that I can start the spec-driven development process.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN a developer runs `/spec-init feature-name "description"` THEN the system SHALL create a new specification directory
- WHEN initialization occurs THEN the system SHALL create requirements.md, design.md, and tasks.md from templates
- WHEN a spec is created THEN the system SHALL set the initial phase to "requirements"
- IF a specification already exists THEN the system SHALL display an error message

### Story 2: Requirements Phase Management

As a developer, I want to gather and document requirements using EARS format so that I have clear, testable specifications.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN a developer runs `/spec-requirements feature-name` THEN the system SHALL guide them through structured requirements gathering
- WHEN requirements are created THEN the system SHALL use EARS format (WHEN/IF/THEN/SHALL)
- WHEN requirements are complete THEN the system SHALL require explicit approval before design phase
- IF requirements are incomplete THEN the system SHALL provide feedback and guidance

### Story 3: Design Documentation Generation

As a developer, I want to create comprehensive design documentation so that I have a clear implementation blueprint.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN a developer runs `/spec-design feature-name` THEN the system SHALL analyze the codebase context
- WHEN design is generated THEN the system SHALL include architecture diagrams, data models, and API interfaces
- WHEN design includes external dependencies THEN the system SHALL research and document integration approaches
- IF design conflicts with existing patterns THEN the system SHALL highlight inconsistencies

### Story 4: Implementation Task Creation

As a developer, I want to break down the design into actionable tasks so that I can implement the feature incrementally.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN a developer runs `/spec-tasks feature-name` THEN the system SHALL generate numbered implementation tasks
- WHEN tasks are created THEN each task SHALL reference specific requirements and design elements
- WHEN tasks are structured THEN they SHALL follow logical dependency order
- IF tasks are too complex THEN the system SHALL break them into sub-tasks

### Story 5: Workflow State Management

As a developer, I want the system to track my progress through the phases so that I can resume work across sessions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN a developer checks status THEN the system SHALL show current phase and progress
- WHEN a phase is completed THEN the system SHALL update the state persistently
- WHEN a developer resumes work THEN the system SHALL continue from the last completed phase
- IF state becomes inconsistent THEN the system SHALL provide recovery options

### Story 6: Cross-Session Continuity

As a developer, I want to continue working on specifications across different Claude Code sessions so that work persists over time.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN a developer starts a new session THEN the system SHALL restore previous specification states
- WHEN work is saved THEN the system SHALL persist state in the file system
- WHEN multiple developers work on the same project THEN the system SHALL share state through version control
- IF state files are corrupted THEN the system SHALL provide recovery mechanisms

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance Requirements
- Command execution SHALL complete within 5 seconds for simple operations
- Design generation SHALL complete within 30 seconds for typical features
- State persistence SHALL not impact interactive session performance

### Usability Requirements
- Commands SHALL provide clear feedback on current phase and next steps
- Error messages SHALL be actionable and guide users toward resolution
- Documentation SHALL be automatically formatted and readable

### Reliability Requirements
- State SHALL persist across Claude Code session restarts
- Hooks SHALL not interfere with normal Claude Code operation
- File operations SHALL be atomic to prevent corruption

### Security Requirements
- Hooks SHALL validate all inputs before execution
- File operations SHALL respect Claude Code's permission system
- State files SHALL not contain sensitive information

## Technical Requirements

### Integration Requirements
- System SHALL integrate with Claude Code's MCP server architecture
- Custom commands SHALL follow Claude Code's slash command conventions
- Hooks SHALL use Claude Code's native hook system (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Notification)
- State management SHALL use Claude Code's session and transcript information

### Data Requirements
- Specifications SHALL be stored in `.specster/specs/{feature-name}/` directory structure
- State information SHALL be stored in `.specster/state/` directory
- Templates SHALL be stored in `.specster/templates/` directory
- Configuration SHALL be stored in `.specster/config/` directory

### Compatibility Requirements
- System SHALL work with Claude Code's existing MCP servers
- Commands SHALL not conflict with Claude Code's built-in slash commands
- Hooks SHALL not interfere with user's existing hook configurations

## Dependencies

### Claude Code Features
- MCP server support for workflow orchestration
- Custom slash commands for user interface
- Hooks system for automation and validation
- Settings system for configuration management
- File system tools for specification management

### External Dependencies
- File system access for specification storage
- Git integration for version control (optional)
- Text processing tools for template expansion

## Out of Scope

### Excluded from Initial Implementation
- Integration with external project management tools
- Advanced conflict resolution for multi-user scenarios
- Visual workflow dashboards or GUIs
- Automated testing framework integration
- Code generation beyond task creation

### Future Enhancements
- Real-time collaboration features
- Integration with issue tracking systems
- Custom template creation interface
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Plugin system for extensibility

## Success Criteria

### Functional Success
- Developers can complete full spec-driven workflow without manual file management
- All three phases (requirements, design, tasks) work seamlessly together
- State persistence maintains continuity across sessions
- Error handling provides clear guidance for recovery

### Technical Success
- MCP server starts and responds within 2 seconds
- Hooks execute without interfering with Claude Code performance
- File operations are atomic and do not corrupt specifications
- Commands integrate naturally with Claude Code's interface

### User Experience Success
- Learning curve is minimal for developers familiar with Claude Code
- Feedback is immediate and actionable
- Documentation generated is professional and comprehensive
- Workflow feels natural and not forced
