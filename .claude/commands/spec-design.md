# Design Phase

I'll create comprehensive design documentation based on your approved requirements.

}
</mcp_call>

## Design Document Generation

Based on your requirements, I'll create a design document that includes:

### Architecture Components

1. **System Architecture** - High-level system design with Mermaid diagrams
2. **Component Interactions** - How different parts work together
3. **Key Design Decisions** - Important architectural choices and rationale

### Technical Specifications

1. **Components and Interfaces** - Detailed component breakdown
2. **Data Models** - Database schemas and data structures
3. **API Interfaces** - Endpoints and data contracts
4. **State Management** - How data flows through the system

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Phase Breakdown** - How to build this incrementally
2. **Error Handling** - How to handle failures gracefully
3. **Security Considerations** - Authentication, authorization, validation
4. **Performance Considerations** - Scaling and optimization strategies

### Research Integration

I'll research relevant technologies and best practices to inform design decisions:
- Current industry standards
- Framework recommendations
- Integration patterns
- Performance benchmarks

The design will be created with your specific requirements in mind, ensuring all user stories and acceptance criteria are addressed in the technical solution.

Once complete, I'll need your explicit approval of the design before proceeding to create implementation tasks.
