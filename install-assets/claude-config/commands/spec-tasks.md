# Implementation Tasks

I'll break down your approved design into actionable implementation tasks.

## Task Breakdown Process

Based on your approved design, I'll create a comprehensive task list that includes:

### Task Organization

1. **Phase-Based Structure** - Tasks organized by implementation phases
2. **Logical Dependencies** - Tasks ordered by their dependencies
3. **Incremental Development** - Each task builds on previous work
4. **Clear Deliverables** - Specific, measurable outcomes

### Task Details

Each task will include:
- **Clear Objective** - What exactly needs to be built
- **Technical Requirements** - Specific technical implementation details
- **Requirements References** - Links back to specific requirements
- **Acceptance Criteria** - How to know the task is complete
- **Time Estimates** - Realistic effort estimates

### Implementation Phases

1. **Foundation Phase** - Core infrastructure and setup
2. **Core Features** - Main functionality implementation
3. **Integration Phase** - Connecting components together
4. **Testing Phase** - Unit, integration, and end-to-end testing
5. **Deployment Phase** - Production readiness

### Quality Assurance

Each task includes:
- **Testing Requirements** - What tests need to be written
- **Code Review Checklist** - Standards to follow
- **Documentation Needs** - What to document
- **Performance Targets** - Metrics to achieve

### Risk Management

For each task, I'll identify:
- **Technical Risks** - Potential implementation challenges
- **Mitigation Strategies** - How to address risks
- **Dependencies** - External requirements
- **Escalation Paths** - What to do if blocked

The tasks are designed to be executed by coding agents and will follow a test-driven development approach where possible.

Once you approve the task breakdown, you can begin implementation or use additional tools to execute specific tasks.
